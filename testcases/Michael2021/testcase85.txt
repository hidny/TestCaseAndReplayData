#Jan 2022:
#Monte likes the 2C because we still need 5 tricks
#and this stops the ai from doing anything silly...
#April 2022:
# Monte says the diff is over 50 points,
# but I think it's because AI might be tempted to play low.
#I'm not 100% sure about that...
#Monte: 2C, 2D, 6D, 8D
# I tried to make a debug case to address this, but
# I didn't find anything interesting. (D-9024)
