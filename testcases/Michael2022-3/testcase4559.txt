#OCT 2022:
# Monte agrees to lead 8TS by 5 points over anything else.
# Hope partner has his spade covered...
# TODO: In the future, this might not be the right idea though
# What if Phil just plays low?
# TODO: 3-4559: make debug case for Phil's decision... (what if it's best to follow low?)
#  But: give Phil 3 spades: with 1 low one.
