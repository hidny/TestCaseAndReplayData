#OCT 2022:
# Monte agrees to lead 8TS by 5 points over anything else.
# Hope partner has his spade covered...
# Already done: 3-4559: make debug case for Phil's decision... (what if it's best to follow low?)
#  But: give Phil 3 spades: with 1 low one.
# Update:
# After fixing the debug cases, D-9034 and D-9035,
# the gap narrowed to 4.4 points over anything else. (or less)
# Update 2:
# I'm actually starting to think we should not lead spade because
# partner is vulnerable... Maybe we're just hoping RHS needs to play high spade?
