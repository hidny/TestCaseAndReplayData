#Sept 2022:
# Monte prefers T8D over QS by 0.5 because RHS can't trump
# I'll just add 8TD as options
# Monte wrongly thinks RHS is void in diamonds though.
# Oct 2022:
# What Monte doesn't know is that Doris has a high chance of having the QD, so I'm not sure.
# Monte prefers 8D TD then QS, but I'm still going to pass club because it makes sense to me.
