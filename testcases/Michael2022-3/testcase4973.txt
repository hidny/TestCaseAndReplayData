#Oct 2022:
# I feel like low H is bad, but draining spade might be good...
# I can't tell if it matters.
# Monte likes low spade by 3 points over high heart. (TS is 1 point less than 8S for some reason)
# It also agrees to play high heart over low heart by only 0.1 points,
# but prefers low heart over JH, which is confusing.
