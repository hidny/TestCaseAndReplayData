Expert response:
QH
Expert alternative response:
JC

#Oct 2022:
# Monte agrees with QH with club being 1.5 points less.
# We want mellow to be vulnerable in hearts 
# and we'll probably get the tricks
# Monte also doesn't really mind 4C, so I'll also pass that (it's 1 point less)
# Update:
# After reruning, monte still prefers QH, but JC is only 0.7ish points off (and 0.08%...)
# and make a lot more sense, so I'll pass JC.
