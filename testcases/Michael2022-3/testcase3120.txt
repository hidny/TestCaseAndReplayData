#April 2022:
# Monte likes bidding 1 by 9 points over mellow,
# but we're behind and we need to make this risky mellow I think.
# Variance is king here!

# May 2022:
# The new utility function confirmed my suspicion!
# Saying mellow gives 21.5 % chance of winning 
# vs saying 1 that has a 18.5% winning the game.
