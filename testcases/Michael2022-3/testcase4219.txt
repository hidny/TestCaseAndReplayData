#Sept 2022:
# Monte really doesn't like 68C. Anything but that!
# It prefers leading spade by 1 point
# Maybe because partner could take lead after spades is led.
# It also doesn't mind 8TD as much as club. (Still 0.3 points less than 2S)
# Oct 2022:
# Doris probably has QD because of the KD sac, so don't lead D even though monte says to do it.
