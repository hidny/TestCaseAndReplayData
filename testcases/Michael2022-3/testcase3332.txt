#May 2022:
# Monte likes to just trump this. (by 1 point over not trumping) 
# It's a simple test case...
# I guess AI was worried about being trumped over
# but that's low-risk.
# The only thing is that maybe RHS is setting us up,
# and Monte didn't properly account for that...
# It's unlikely though. Only 7 clubs were played so far.
