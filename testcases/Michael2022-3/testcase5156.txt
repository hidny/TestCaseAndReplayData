# Nov 2022:
# Monte very slightly prefers KC
# by 0.37 points over JS
# I'll pass all options because it's close.
# Second run prefers KC by 1.3 points...
# I'll still pass all three because I'm confused.
# 7S is 1 point less than 9S,JS for some reason...
# I don't get it.
# Update:
# Since I don't get it, I don't want to bother fixing it,
# and I'll pass it.
