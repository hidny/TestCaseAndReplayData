#April 2022:
# Monte likes 3 over 2 by 5 points,
# but we might want to lower the bid and not risk burning.
# Saying 1 is just too low... (You have 2 aces!)
# There's almost a full 9 point diff between saying 1 and 2.
# Maybe don't lower the bid if you're the second bidder on the team, and 1st bidder bid > 1?
# I'll add 1 as an option anyways.
