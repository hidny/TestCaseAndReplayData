#Nov 2021:
#Monte likes low heart then JH
#Then D, then C
#I'll go with Monte on hearts and Club.

#Nov 20th:
#Monte likes anything but 5S or 9C...
#But I now like the 9C, and I'm just going to pass this test case.
#For context, Phil signalled JS or nothing and Doris has 0 spade.
#9C will just force out Phil/LHS's JS if he has it...
