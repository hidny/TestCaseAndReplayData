#Monte Dec 2021:
# Mellow worth -40.6 points
# 1 is worth -85.1 points.
# I tried making the AI more willing to say mellow if player doesn't even have 1,
# but that didn't go far enough.
# Maybe the odds of winning this mellow are as high as 45% justifying going for it?
# I don't know. QJT5D looks a little scary to me. (Even though there's only 1 spade.)
# I did the math and the function will say mellow if it's given a 47.8% chance of making it.

#March 2022:
# I got AI to say mellow here

#Oct 2022:
# Monte says mellow by 40 points
# and WPMonte by 5.9%
# Mellow is -42 points when 1 is -83 points
# They are both dangerous choices.
