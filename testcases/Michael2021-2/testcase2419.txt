#March 2022:
#Monte prefers saying 2 over 1 by 0.5 points
# But it really really likes saying mellow
# 157 points for mellow and 3.5 points for saying 1
# I don't get it! I'm pretty sure monte noticed that the opponent will make a mistake?
# i.e. This is wrong... (This was confirmed!)

#Oct 2022:
# WP Monte likes 2 over 1 by 0.75%
# but regular monte like 1 over 2 by 0.7 points
# I'll go with WP Monte.
# Monte now is reasonable about not saying mellow.
# WP Monte likes 3 almost as much as 2.
# I'll be nice and pass bids 2, 3, and 1
