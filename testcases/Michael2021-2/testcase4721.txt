#Dec 2021:
# You bid 5, don't throw AC...
# Monte likes 9S, then AS, then 76S
# Monte thinks any spade is 24 points because than anything else.
# It then want to save the high ones, because
# it knows we are close to burning.
# I'll let the low offsuits pass even though monte thinks that's
# worse than trumping just because
