#Dec 2021:
#Monte: QS by 4 points (I don't see why QS is bad...)
# Monte goes: QS, 5H, 9H. TJD, AD
#I don't get why 59H is recommended though.
#Maybe monte thinks mellow may have AC?
#Because Monte likes the 5H so much, I'll pass the 5H
#(5H is 2-3 points more than 9H)
# I don't think I'll be able to explain why the 5H is a better throw than the 9H...
