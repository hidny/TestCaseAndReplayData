Cards in hand:

Expert response:
9H
Expert alternative response:

#Don't waste a KD when there's 3 other diamonds
#Also, waste 9H because mellow signalled only hearts lower than 9H
#AH and 9H have the same value, but AH signals that you're sacrificing a trick
#but you're not doing that, so it confuses your partner.
