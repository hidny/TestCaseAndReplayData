# Nov 2022:
# Monte prefers the 1 card I didn't like by 0.7 points (3C)
# I'll just pass everything
# It's a confusing test case because the AIs aren't playing well.
# Ex: partner didn't need to waste the AC, or lead 8C...
# Maybe 8C was best choice, but that's hard to believe.
# Update:
# What if protector knows mellow has AH, but 2nd will trump??? oh well...
