AD
Expert alternative response:

#(March 2021:)Maybe the attacker left of mellow would rather lead than let attacker right of mellow lead???
# Logic I want to see:
# If JD is the best richard can come up with, lead to try and burn mellow...
#Maybe take the trick to stop Partner from leading diamonds a third time.
