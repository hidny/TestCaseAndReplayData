#(March 2021:)Maybe the attacker left of mellow would rather lead than let attacker right of mellow lead???
# Logic I want to see:
# If JD is the best richard can come up with, lead to try and burn mellow...
#Maybe take the trick to stop Partner from leading diamonds a third time.

#Nov 2021:
#Monte confirmed AKD is 7 points better than 2D

#Oct 2022:
# Monte now says to play 2D by 0.8 points.
# Monte thinks Mellow has no spade or diamond...
# I'm confused.
