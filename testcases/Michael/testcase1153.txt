#June 22nd, 2021: computer played 9S, and I liked it.
#Anything else just feeds the opponent on RHS (Doris)
#Maybe TC is ok because partner knows I'm feeding RHS?
#Monte carlo agrees with me... barely
#Oct 2022:
# Monte doesn't get this test case. It had to no-skip
# Monte now avoids leading spade and leads TC by 0.2 points
