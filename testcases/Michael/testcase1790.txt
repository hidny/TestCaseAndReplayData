Expert alternative response:


#Don't lead C because partner can't trump
#and one of the opponents will.
# May 2022:
# Monte actually likes to lead QC and force out a spade.
# This is a weird case where we want to dare opponents to trump...
# Clubs is better than D because more clubs were played and LHS/RHS is more likely to trump
# Better by 40 points over AD and 18 points over KH
