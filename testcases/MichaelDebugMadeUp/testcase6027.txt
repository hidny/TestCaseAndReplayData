#Last round weirdness.
#Bid min needed to win or mellow.

#March 2022:
# Modified version of D-6010, so monte can understand it.
# Basically, I changed it so Richard says 3 because he has to say 3 or mellow.
# That way the opponents aren't shooting themselves in the foot.
# After doing the math, I calculated that it's better to say mellow here. (mellow vs 6)
