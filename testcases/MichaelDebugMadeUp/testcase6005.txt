Expert response:
4S
Expert alternative response:
7S 5C 6C TC
#Lead spade to help partner who bid 6
#Leading hearts didn't work out (opponents trumped)

#Latest monte:
#low club
#order: 56C TC 4S AH 7S
#Adding low club as an option
#Oct 24th, 2021: (Me: AHA Michael's 1 bid is probably for trumping, so lead S)
#OR: Lead AH when opponents have no spade.
