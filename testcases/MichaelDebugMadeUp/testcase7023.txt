# April 2022:
# Doris burned this 4 spade mellow.
# Is mellow a good choice here? Ask monte!
# Maybe it could make sense given the score?
# Monte is currently pretty indifferent!
# Maybe the scores are triggering some bad behaviour that
# causes monte to misjudge? For now, I'll pass this...
# but I might want to revisit later.
