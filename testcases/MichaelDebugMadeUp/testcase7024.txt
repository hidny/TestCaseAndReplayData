# April 2022:
# Why not lead club?
# Monte might not get this test case
# Partner probably has less/no club.
# Monte doesn't get it!

#May 2022:
# Even when we assume partner has no club,
# Monte still wants to play spade or KH
# It even prefers to lead the 9H.
# I'm confused, so I'll just pass more leads.
