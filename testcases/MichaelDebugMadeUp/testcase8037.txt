#Nov 2022:
# Is saying 1 really the best bid?
# Weird end-of-game test case.
# WPMonte prefers syaing 5 then 4 (91%)
# then 3 (87%)
# I refuse to bid six.
# I had the logic bid low because it's near the end of the game,
# but that might not be best here.
# Actually, maybe it is... I don't know...
# For now, I'll fail the 1 bid.
