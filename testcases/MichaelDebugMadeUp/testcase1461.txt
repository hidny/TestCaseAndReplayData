Expert response:
KH
Expert alternative response:
8C 9C

#Prefer leading the KH first
#Modified 0-1461 to have more realistic bids.
#Cash out on KH before playing AD.
#Monte also likes the 8C for some reason.
#Aha: 8C gives lead to someone else, and that someone might lead H, or D, or S.
#Either way, you're happy.
