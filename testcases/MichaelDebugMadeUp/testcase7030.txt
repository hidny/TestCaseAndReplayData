# Oct 2022:
# WP monte likes QD while Monte likes JS (It was only a 5000 sample though)
# The other spades are 0.15 points worse than JS except 4S.
# 4S is 0.25 points worse
# I made this test case because I was confused about how a round started.
# 2nd run thought QD then 9S then JS... so who knows.
