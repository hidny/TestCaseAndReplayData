#Don't lead into suit mellow is probably safe/void in
#It turns out that in the game, it didn't really matter, but it's the principle!
#Nov 2021:
#Actually, mellow can still burn in Heart
#And monte prefers Heart.
#Monte also likes the QC, so I'll add that as an option.
#(I could picture myself leading QC...)
