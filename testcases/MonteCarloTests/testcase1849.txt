#I currently prefer leading into suit where king is safe
#over leading suit that only has 1 card.
#Monte like playing H, playing 8S, then playing low D
#Don't play JD... (Cost half a point)
#Oct 23rd:
#Me: Don't play JD or QH?
#Monte: All within 1 point (hard to tell diff)
#(1st order: 4H 78H, then 8S then 64D)
#(2nd order: 4H, then 8S, then 78H, then JS)
#No JD, QH, or AS
