#Dec 2021:
#Don't lead 2C because mellow signalled 3C or void
#Monte agrees.
#Monte also barely prefers KD over JD.
#Maybe monte is right because partner is void
#and can't imagine a case where JD wins but the KD doesn't.
#Interesting...
#Ex1: if mellow has QD and protector AD,
# I might as well play KD
#Ex2: if mellow has QD and AD and protector has 2 lower ones,
# KD just delays the inevitable burn
#Ex3: if mellow has AD, QD, and 1 other D, mellow isn't burning
# no matter what  I play.
